"""In-memory log of recent Superpos task summaries, keyed by chat_id.

Superpos tasks run in fresh Codex sessions with no shared memory of the
Telegram conversation. When the user sees a task-completion notification in
Telegram and replies with a follow-up ("what did the failure mean?"), the
Telegram session has no context for that reference.

This log captures a compact summary of each completed Superpos task so the
next Telegram message in the same chat can be primed via system_prompt_append.
In-memory only — survives across requests but not across container restarts,
which is acceptable for transient conversational context.
